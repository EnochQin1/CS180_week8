    Network I/O
        - Internet Protocol (IP)
        Identifies hosts with a unique address
        - Domain Name System (DNS)
        Maps domain names to IP addresses
        - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
        identifies ports on hosts for a network connection

        IP address plus TCP port
        two sockets makes a network connection

        Client-Server
        - A server is a process that waits for a connection
        - A client is a process that connects to a server
        - At different times, a process may be both a client and a server
        - Need not be associated with a specific computer: any computer
        can have both client and server processes running on it
        - Once connected, the client and server can both read and write data to
        one another asynchronously
        Clients and Server communicate via Sockets
        Socket: IP address plus TCP port
        street name + house number
        IP address - byte notation, unique, computer on the internet, some firewalls translate addresses
        to internal ones

        Java objects can be written to and read from files
        exchanged over network connections
